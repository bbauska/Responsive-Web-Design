# Responsive-Web-Design
Scrape PDF of Responsive Web Design creating a markdown for subsequent editing.  Make it beautiful.

Use on-line ZAMZAR to convert .PDF to .MD.  Then edit it so it's functional in github as a readme.

Finally, convert to index.html and make it an online book.  With TOC and page/section reference at the end. 
Kind of like an index.  But Sections rather than page numbers.
